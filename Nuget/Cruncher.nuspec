      A CSS, LESS, SASS, SCSS, CoffeeScript, and JavaScript Preprocessor for ASP.NET

      Cruncher makes optimising your resources easy.
      Cruncher can bundle unlimited combinations of remote and local CSS, LESS, SASS, SCSS, CoffeeScript, and JavaScript files. It combines them, minifies them and caches them in the browser.
      It can handle nested css @import statements, re-maps relative resource urls and has a self cleaning cache should any changes be made to any of the referenced files.
      It'll even gzip compress the output.
